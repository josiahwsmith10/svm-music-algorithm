# svm-music-algorithm
 In this project, we will examine the work of ElGonnouni et al. [1] towards developing robust direction-of-arrival
 (DoA) estimation. First, a mathematical relationship between the
 Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) and the
 MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) DoA algorithms. Then,
 a support vector machine (SVM) extension of these techniques
 is introduced and the results between all four variants are
 compared.
